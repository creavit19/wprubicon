<p>Greenlee&nbsp;is adding a state-of-the-art puller to its reliable Greenlee lineup with the new G10 TUGGER. The Greenlee G10 TUGGER features a two-speed custom-designed motor that is capable of continuously pulling up to 8,000 pounds and a maximum pulling force of 10,000 pounds. The improved motor helps increase productivity by reducing downtime, while the force indicator display helps prevent damage to the puller and cable.</p>

<p>‚ÄúReducing downtime is the key to improving the pull time,‚Äù said Jae Lee, director of product management, Greenlee for Emerson. ‚ÄúThe engineering team focused on increasing the continuous pulling force to achieve this goal. This puller gives workers the ability to better accomplish the job without the frequent downtime caused by changing the speed of the motor and giving the motor time to cool down.‚Äù</p>

<p>The innovative motor board design on the G10 TUGGER efficiently uses electricity to create a better pull performance. Additional key features include:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Force Indicator Display</strong> - Visually shows the operator the pull in increments of 1,000 pounds, giving the operator more control.</li><li><strong>Right-Angle Sheave</strong> - Designed to help keep operators outside the direct line of the pull.</li><li><strong>Multi-Purpose Foot Switch</strong> - Empowers the user to select between high or low speed, as well as starting and stopping the pull, while keeping the operator outside of the direct line of the pull.</li></ul>

<p>The G10 TUGGER is cULus Listed and compatible with the Greenlee ULTRA TUGGER<sup>¬Æ</sup> mounting systems, allowing contractors to easily adapt the new cable puller to existing equipment. Mounting options include the Mobile VersiBoom‚Ñ¢ providing fast, one person set up; the chain mount for tighter spaces; or the floor mount, which provides the ultimate flexibility for pulling applications. The G10 TUGGER can be purchased individually or with any of the mounting systems.</p>

<p>‚ÄúContractors have been asking how to make the cable pull more efficient and we designed the G10 TUGGER to address their concerns. This cable puller will benefit contractors who work in new and remodeling environments such as upgrades to hospitals, warehouses, factories and data centers," said Lee.</p>
